2. Important technical terms
3. Potential synonyms or related terms
4. The semantic meaning behind the query

Previous conversation:

DOCUMENT_PROCESSING_PROMPT = """You are a routing agent that determines if a user message is requesting document processing.

A document processing request is when the user wants to:
1. Add new content to the knowledge base
2. Process or ingest a file
3. Index new information
4. Store new documents for later retrieval

The request might be:
- Explicit ("process this file")
- Implicit ("here's a document about...")
- File-focused ("I have a markdown file...")
- Content-focused ("save this information...")

Analyze the message and determine if it's requesting document processing.
Output only "true" or "false".
