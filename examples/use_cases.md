# Multi-Agent System Use Cases

This document showcases various examples of how the multi-agent system can be used, demonstrating both individual agent capabilities and combined workflows.

## Individual Agent Examples

### 1. Research Agent

**Q: "Research about microservices"**

The research agent will:
1. Gather information from multiple credible sources
2. Evaluate source credibility
3. Synthesize findings with proper citations
4. Provide confidence assessments

Example Response:
```
Here are the findings from my research:

[Sources]
- Medium: Best Practices for Microservice Design [Credibility: Medium]
- Wikipedia: Microservices [Credibility: High]
(Additional sources...)

[Key Findings]
1. Design Principles and Trends
2. Tools and Technologies
3. Emerging Trends
...

[Confidence Assessment]
- Overall Confidence: High
- Areas of Uncertainty
- Information Gaps
```

### 2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Agent

**Q: "Process this research as a document and save in the vector db"**

The RAG agent will:
1. Process the content into chunks
2. Add metadata (type, source, timestamp)
3. Store in the vector database
4. Confirm successful processing

Example Response:
```
Successfully processed document: research_results
- Number of chunks: 6
- Document type: inline

You can now ask questions about this document!
```

**Q: "Search in this document about microservices architecture"**

The RAG agent will:
1. Search the vector database
2. Retrieve relevant passages
3. Present findings with sources

Example Response:
```
Here's what I found in the document:

1. The microservices architecture is characterized by...
2. Key components include...

Based on:
- Source: knowledge_base, research_results, timestamp: 2025-02-14
```

### 3. React Agent (Diagram Generation)

**Q: "Create a diagram about the microservices architecture"**

The React agent will:
1. Analyze the content
2. Generate a Mermaid.js diagram
3. Save and display the result

Example Response:
```
I've created a visual representation of the components and their relationships.

The Mermaid.js diagram has been generated and saved to: architecture.mmd

Here's the diagram content:
flowchart TD
    Component1 --> Component2
    ...

You can now ask questions about the diagram!
```

### 4. Summarizer Agent

**Q: "Summarize this technical documentation"**

The summarizer agent will:
1. Process the document in chunks
2. Generate a concise summary
3. Maintain key technical details

Example Response:
```
Here's the summary I generated:

[Summary Content]
The documentation covers...

Document Statistics:
- Number of chunks processed: 8
```

## Combined Workflows

### Research → Process → Visualize Flow

This example shows how multiple agents work together:

1. Initial Research Request:
```
Human: Research about microservices
AI: [Detailed research response with sources and findings]
```

2. Document Processing:
```
Human: Process this research as document
AI: [Confirmation of document processing with metadata]
```

3. Information Retrieval:
```
Human: Search in this document about microservices
AI: [Retrieved relevant information with sources]
```

4. Visualization:
```
Human: Create a diagram about it
AI: [Generated and saved Mermaid.js diagram]
```

This workflow demonstrates how the system can:
- Gather comprehensive research
- Store information for future retrieval
- Extract specific insights
- Create visual representations
- Maintain context throughout the interaction

### Research → Summarize Flow

Another common workflow:

1. Research Phase:
```
Human: Research about cloud computing trends
AI: [Detailed research findings]
```

2. Summarization:
```
Human: Summarize these findings
AI: [Concise summary with key points]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow Down**
   - Begin with research queries
   - Process important findings
   - Ask specific questions about processed content

2. **Leverage Multiple Agents**
   - Combine research with visualization
   - Process findings for future reference
   - Use summaries for long content

3. **Maintain Context**
   - Reference previous findings in follow-up questions
   - Build on processed documents
   - Create visual representations of complex topics

## Tips for Optimal Results

1. **Research Queries**
   - Be specific about the topic
   - Mention if you need specific types of sources
   - Ask for confidence assessments

2. **Document Processing**
   - Process research results for future reference
   - Store important findings in the vector database
   - Use clear markers for content types

3. **Visualization Requests**
   - Specify diagram type if needed
   - Ask for specific relationship visualization
   - Request modifications if needed

4. **Combined Workflows**
   - Plan your query sequence
   - Build on previous results
   - Use processed documents for follow-up questions
