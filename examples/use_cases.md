# Multi-Agent System Use Cases

This document showcases various examples of how the multi-agent system can be used, demonstrating both individual agent capabilities and combined workflows.

## Individual Agent Examples

### 1. Knowledge Agent

**Q: "What information do we have about microservices?"**

The knowledge agent will:
1. Search internal document database first
2. If no relevant documents are found, search external sources
3. Grade and format results with proper citations
4. Present findings with confidence level

Example Response:
```
Based on our available knowledge, here's what I found about microservices:

[Source 1] [Internal - Enterprise Architecture Guide]: Microservices architecture divides applications into loosely coupled services, each responsible for specific business capabilities...

[Source 2] [Web - Martin Fowler's Blog (martinfowler.com)]: The microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process...

Additional insights:
- Each microservice runs independently and communicates via APIs
- Benefits include scalability, resilience, and technology flexibility
- Challenges include distributed system complexity and data consistency
```

### 2. Document Retrieval

**Q: "What do we know about blockchain consensus mechanisms?"**

The knowledge agent will:
1. Search the vector database for relevant passages
2. Retrieve and format passages with source information
3. Present findings in a structured way

Example Response:
```
Here's what I found in our knowledge base about blockchain consensus mechanisms:

[Source 1] [Internal - blockchain_research_paper.pdf]: The paper discusses three primary consensus mechanisms: Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)...

[Source 2] [Internal - blockchain_research_paper.pdf]: Newer consensus mechanisms like Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) are designed to address the energy consumption issues of PoW...

The document emphasizes that consensus mechanism selection should be based on specific use case requirements, security needs, and scalability concerns.
```

### 3. Summarizer Agent

**Q: "Summarize this technical documentation"**

The summarizer agent will:
1. Process the document in chunks
2. Generate a concise summary using a map-reduce approach
3. Maintain key technical details

Example Response:
```
Here's the summary of the technical documentation:

[Summary Content]
This documentation covers the implementation of a distributed data processing framework with the following key components:
1. Data ingestion layer supporting batch and stream processing
2. Computation engine with support for SQL and custom functions
3. Storage layer with tiered architecture (hot, warm, cold)
...

Document Statistics:
- Number of chunks processed: 8
- Original document length: ~24,000 words
- Processing time: 12.3 seconds
```

## Combined Workflows

### Knowledge Search → External Search

This example shows how multiple agents work together:

1. Initial Knowledge Query:
```
Human: What information do we have about quantum computing?
AI: I don't have any internal documents about quantum computing. Would you like me to search external sources?
Human: Yes, please search online.
AI: [Detailed response with information from online sources]
```

2. Follow-up Question:
```
Human: Based on that information, what are the main challenges in quantum computing?
AI: [Response focusing on challenges, citing external sources]
```

This workflow demonstrates how the system can:
- Check internal knowledge before searching externally
- Use external search when internal knowledge is insufficient
- Maintain context throughout the interaction
- Provide consistently formatted responses with proper citations

### Research → Summarize Flow

Another common workflow:

1. Knowledge Gathering Phase:
```
Human: Find information about recent developments in renewable energy
AI: [Detailed findings from external sources]
```

2. Summarization:
```
Human: Summarize these findings into a brief report
AI: [Concise summary with key points, organized by topic]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Internal Knowledge**
   - Let the system check its internal knowledge base first
   - Request external searches only when needed

2. **Leverage Multiple Agents**
   - Use the knowledge agent for fact-based queries
   - Use the summarizer for condensing large texts

3. **Maintain Context**
   - Reference previous findings in follow-up questions
   - Use clear, specific questions for better retrieval

## Tips for Optimal Results

1. **Knowledge Queries**
   - Be specific about what you're looking for
   - Indicate if you want only internal knowledge or external sources too
   - Ask for confidence levels or source quality assessment

2. **Combined Workflows**
   - Start broad, then go deeper with follow-up questions
   - Use summarization for lengthy content or multiple sources
