        # and they are not installed by default, you might need:
        # poetry install --no-interaction --no-root --with dev
        # However, typically `pytest` and other testing tools are in the main dev group which is installed by default.

      run: |
        poetry run pytest
        # If tests are not in the root or a standard 'tests' directory, specify path:
        # poetry run pytest ./tests
